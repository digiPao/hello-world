# hello-world
My first repository on Github

Hi everybody,
I'm Paolino from Italy and this Saturdaty morning I decided to do something to add new skills to my resume by exploring some new IT-related subjects.
Honestly I've been intrigued by videogames since I was a child and maybe I'm gonna try to sue that path, even though it's a bit late (well, I still have some spare time anyhow).
